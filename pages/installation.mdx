# Installation

### Requirements
Before installing Strig, make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).

Install using `PIP`

``` bash
pip install strig
```

Note that `pip` refers to the Python 3 package manager. In an environment where Python 2 is also present the correct command may be `pip3`.
